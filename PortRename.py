# Outline:
# 1. Need to know if the ports are in a LAG
# 2. Build two different functions depending on the answer
# 3. Be able to handle many different Sections of renaming...
# 3a. This includes being able to repeat until all port names on box are complete
# 3b. All printed onto one copyable output

# This could be anything, like we are just adding the P_LOOP for example recently.
# This particular group of ports that are having P_Loop added are considered 1 'section' of ports
# This will also be the Dictionary Key later in the script.

#Laged Port Section
